# nosql-challenge
I am working with a MacBook Pro that runs on an M2 chip, which is seemingly incompatible with MongoDB. Due to this, I seem to get recurring errors with certain mongo based functions. I did my best to code this assignment in a way that I think would work and get the results I needed based on class activity examples and internet searches.

With that said, this activity focuses on restaurants in the London area and their hygiene scores. We use pymongo to search the MongoDB database in order to query results, create DataFrames, and conduct exploratory analyses on that data.
